# Image-classification
# This project is about House image classification using Convolutional neural network.
# Steps:
  # 0.Loading the required libraries
  # 1.Set up the path
  # 2.Defining Categories
  # 3.Resizing image and storing them in the form of an array with their respective labels.
  # 4.Normalization
  # 5.Spliting the data into train and test
  # 6.Defining CNN architecture and training the CNN model
  # 7.Loading the test data and performing the steps 2 to 4
  # 8.Using the CNN model for Predicitons
